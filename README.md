# Battlefield Simulator
### Released August 2022

<br/>

## Description
Battlefield Simulator is a p5.js project to simulate a battle between
two armies, red and blue. Different objects, like bridges and walls,
can be toggled on the terrain, and soldiers and towers can be placed
individually or spawned all at once.

<br/>

## Note
The game may occasionally "freeze" when no soldiers are able to move
or hit an opponent due to the simplicity of their targeting and
pathfinding algorithms.
